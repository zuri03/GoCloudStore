todo:
    Set up kubernetes

    set up go tests

    set up tls for each of the apis

    Implement system logging

    Use Bufio for sending files in loop
        
    setup authentication on mongo
    
Future Plans:
    Make desktop app that uses the client to send data to server
    
    Multiple data storage servers:
        - currently I am using only a single storage server for development
        - however, in the full project must be able to work with multiple data servers
        - I will need to determine a way to get the ip's of all of the data servers
        - When the user request to store a file in the system the meta server must reply with an ip of the data server that it will send its data to
        - In order to make sure there is an even distribution among data servers we could use a hashring
            - although this may be unnecessary since we do not expect the data servers to suddenly go offline 
        - also need a way to determine the ip addresses of the data server so that the meta server can use them


Bugs:
    mongo is not creating collections

    return message from record server letting client know the record exists

    Makefile clean target is not working

Improvements:
    remove common package

    use json encoder in each handler

    return json objects in post requests

    improve design of records for better unit tests
        - remove http response writing and request reading logic from middleware and handler funcitons

    make db structs thread safe
        - http clients are already thread safe

    come up with a better name for allowedUsers
        allowed users is a list of users that are allowed to retrieve a file despite not being the owner
        PrivlidgedUser?

    Reduce docker image size

    seperating the client and the cli:
        - If I will implement an electron app for the system then I will need to seperate the cli logic from the client logic so that the client logic can be reused

    determine best numerical values for file transfer constant values
