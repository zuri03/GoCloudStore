Completely refactor client to fit new architecture
    client must first send http request to metadata server for file location
    client must open tcp connection to correct data server and read file data from tcp connection
    Determine how to optimize connections by using the least amount of connections possible

Add rest api to record keeper
    Rest api exposes endpoints to get/delete/create/update records
    each record can be accessed with a key set by user during record creation
    Get:
        Get request requires username/password/key which are encoded within the url
        ensure that the user reqeusting the record is allowed access to the record
    Create:
        create a new record using filename/filesize/owner/key all other fields are optional
        if optional fields are not provided use default values
            determine default values for optional fields
        if any of the required fields are missing return a bad request status code along with error
        fields are json encoded within the body of the request
    delete:
        TBD
    update:
        TBD

Add database support to record keeper  
    records will be stored in a database for persistant storage
    determine which database to use for the record keeper

Set up data node:
    data node will contain the file data referenced by the records in records storage
