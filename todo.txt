Completely refactor client to fit new architecture
    client must first send http request to metadata server for file location
    client must open tcp connection to correct data server and read file data from tcp connection
    Determine how to optimize connections by using the least amount of connections possible

set up one time command/client 
    when the user does not supply the cli option a single use client will be created 
    create switch to read the command and execute a function 
    program will run once no need for a manual shutdown by user
    use flag package to parse command parameters
        parse flag options in main.go of the client

Add rest api to record keeper
    Add dynamic urls to paths
    

Add database support to record keeper  
    records will be stored in a database for persistant storage
    determine which database to use for the record keeper

Set up data node:
    data node will contain the file data referenced by the records in records storage
