Set up kubernetes

set up go tests

Reduce docker image size

set up tls for each of the apis

come up with a better name for allowedUsers
    allowed users is a list of users that are allowed to retrieve a file despite not being the owner
    PrivlidgedUser?

determine best numerical values for constants

Implement system logging

fix makefile

Use Bufio for sending files in loop

setup timeouts with connections

make db structs thread safe
    http clients are already thread safe
    
setup authentication on mongo

improve design of records for better unit tests
  - remove http response writing and request reading logic from middleware and handler funcitons
500 error is returned from records when trying to send the same file twice

refactor handlers for record server
    - Remove http.Resposne Writer and http.request from the helper functions in the handlers
    - only the handler can be resposnible for the 

Improve communication protocol
    - right now communication is handled by a series of signals that represent actions a client wishes to take
    - instead create an object representing a single message
    - this object will be gob encoded by the entity and decoded by the other

Multiple data storage servers:
    - currently I am using only a single storage server for development
    - however, in the full project must be able to work with multiple data servers
    - I will need to determine a way to get the ip's of all of the data servers
    - When the user request to store a file in the system the meta server must reply with an ip of the data server that it will send its data to
    - In order to make sure there is an even distribution among data servers we could use a hashring
        - although this may be unnecessary since we do not expect the data servers to suddenly go offline 
    - also need a way to determine the ip addresses of the data server so that the meta server can use them

seperating the client and the cli:
    - If I will implement an electron app for the system then I will need to seperate the cli logic from the client logic so that the client logic can be reused
    
Future Plans:
    Make desktop app that uses the client to send data to server
    Add data replication to storage servers
