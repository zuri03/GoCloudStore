todo:
    Set up kubernetes

    set up tls for each of the apis

    Use Bufio for sending files in loop
        
    setup authentication on mongo

    change all references of allowedUser to PrivlidgedUser

in development:
    set up go tests

    Implement system logging

    fix server error responses
        - server error responses should contain a message that is only meant for the user
    
Future Plans:
    Make desktop app that uses the client to send data to server
    
    Multiple data storage servers:
        - currently I am using only a single storage server for development
        - however, in the full project must be able to work with multiple data servers
        - I will need to determine a way to get the ip's of all of the data servers
        - When the user request to store a file in the system the meta server must reply with an ip of the data server that it will send its data to
        - In order to make sure there is an even distribution among data servers we could use a hashring
            - although this may be unnecessary since we do not expect the data servers to suddenly go offline 
        - also need a way to determine the ip addresses of the data server so that the meta server can use them

    data replication

Bugs:
    Makefile clean target is not working

Improvements:
    remove common package

    use json encoder in each handler

    return json objects in post requests

    improve design of records for better unit tests

    make db structs thread safe

    Reduce docker image size
        - First need to research techniques and reduce docker images

    seperating the client and the cli:
        - If I will implement an electron app for the system then I will need to seperate the cli logic from the client logic so that the client logic can be reused

    determine best numerical values for file transfer constant values
