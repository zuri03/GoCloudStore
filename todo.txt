Set up kubernetes

set up go tests

Reduce docker image size

set up tls for each of the rest apis

come up with a better name for allowedUsers
    allowed users is a list of users that are allowed to retrieve a file despite not being the owner
    PrivlidgedUser?

Determine how allowed system works
    for now allowed users is simply a slice of usernames
    need to determine the best way to store users in this slice

determine best numerical values for constants

Implement system logging

fix makefile

Use Bufio for sending files in loop

setup timeouts with connections

improve error handling for record keeper

make db structs thread safe

setup authentication on mongo

Improve communication protocol
    - right now communication is handled by a series of signals that represent actions a client wishes to take
    - instead create an object representing a single message
    - this object will be gob encoded by the entity and decoded by the other


Future Plans:
    Make desktop app that uses the client to send data to server
    May combine the user and record keeper service
