todo:
    set up tls for each of the apis

    Use Bufio for sending files in loop
        
    setup authentication on mongo

    change all references of allowedUser to PrivlidgedUser

    Fault tolerance
        records server sends health checks to each data server

    create a makefile

    seperate user service from record keeper
    

in development:
    set up go tests

    Implement system logging
    
Future Plans:
    Make desktop app that uses the client to send data to server
    
    Multiple data storage servers:
        - currently I am using only a single storage server for development
        - however, in the full project must be able to work with multiple data servers
        - I will need to determine a way to get the ip's of all of the data servers
        - When the user request to store a file in the system the meta server must reply with an ip of the data server that it will send its data to
        - In order to make sure there is an even distribution among data servers we could use a hashring
            - although this may be unnecessary since we do not expect the data servers to suddenly go offline 
        - also need a way to determine the ip addresses of the data server so that the meta server can use them

    data replication

Bugs:
    Makefile clean target is not working

    when the storage server sends an error frame to the client while the clients 
    expects file data the client will simply write the error frame bytes to the file
        - likely fix: wrap each piece of file data in a frame so when the client reads file data is can check the frame type before deciding what to do next
        
    cli simply appends file data received from server   
        - needs to be able to identify and append new additions not present in local version

    server returns 400 error when space is added to username

    sending files from server to client is unreliable (works sometimes doesn't work other times)

Improvements:
    remove common package

    use json encoder in each handler

    return json objects in post requests

    improve design of records for better unit tests

    make db structs thread safe

    Reduce docker image size
        - First need to research techniques and reduce docker images

    seperating the client and the cli:
        - If I will implement an electron app for the system then I will need to seperate the cli logic from the client logic so that the client logic can be reused

    determine best numerical values for file transfer constant values

    adjust permission bits for opening files
